This was initially inspired by a project I saw on dev.to to [create a personal npm card](https://dev.to/cdthomp1/create-your-own-npm-card-ejp), this was a great project, and I followed it through and loved the result, but thought I could expand on the idea.

If you look at my portfolio you can see I like to experiment with different ways to make and present a CV, so I thought this could add to that theme by creating a npm CV.
